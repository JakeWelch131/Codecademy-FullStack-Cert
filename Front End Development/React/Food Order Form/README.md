# Food Order Form

## Context: Your goal is to create a functional form that allows customers to place their orders easily. Once the customer submits the form, the form will alert them about their order details. You will be provided with a menu and your task is to create a form that can take in customer details such as name, phone number, address, and order.

To complete this project, you will use your understanding of controlled React forms. Youâ€™ll be using the State Hook to manage the state of the form, and employ event handlers to update the state of the form as the customer fills in their details.
