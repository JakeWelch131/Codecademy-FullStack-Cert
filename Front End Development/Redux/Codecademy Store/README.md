# Codecademy Store

## The purpose of this project is to practice Redux elements such as the store and altering the state

## Context: In this project, you’ll build a program that mimics Codecademy’s own online store! The application should display products from the Codecademy store and allow the user to add them to their cart. In the cart, the user can adjust the quantity of each item and the running total will be displayed at the bottom. Lastly, the user can choose the currency for the entire application.

## most of the inventory and currency features have been built for you. It will be up to you to:

complete the cart’s action creators and reducer logic
create the store using createStore() and combineReducers()
pass the store resources to presentational components via the top-level <App /> component
render the <Cart /> component using the current state data
dispatch actions to the store
