# Film Finder

## In this project, I used my knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. Youâ€™ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion. 
## The html and css were already written for this project. 
## Data is from https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US
