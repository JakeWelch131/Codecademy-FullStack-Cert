# GitHub OAuth Application

## In this off-platform project, I used GitHub to authenticate the web application.

# To Run this project:
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the folder in the CLI
- Once you are in the working directory, run: npm install
- After Node has been installed, run: npm start and navigate to the localhost port
