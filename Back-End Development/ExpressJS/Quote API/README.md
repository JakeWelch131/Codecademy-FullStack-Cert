# Quote API

## In this project, I built a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.

## I was given some starter code in the form of a front-end site and some Express.js boilerplate. I used this to build several route handlers to serve up interesting quotes. As I built out the app, I tested out the functionality either using a tool called Postman. Most of my work was done in server.js
