# Quote Keeper

## In this project, you will write a feature test for the development of a web application that allows users to save and display a collection of their favorite quotes. We will call this app “Quote Keeper”.

## Quote Keeper should allow users to enter the following information about each quote they would like to save to the app:

- The quote itself
- Who the quote is attributed to
- The source of the quote:
  - Book
  - Article
  - Speech
  - IRL
## Because this course focuses on feature tests at the top level of the TDD Testing Pyramid, this project will only cover the feature tests process up to the point of getting an error about the exercise phase of your test suite.
