# RESTful Restaurants

## In this project, I built an API to connect the front-end and back-end of a restaurant review site. This site will allow its users to view a list of saved restaurants, add to that list, star their favorite restaurants, and leave comments about these places. I was provided the front-end and some of the API routes were already set up as examples. I addied the remaining routes needed to handle starred restaurants and comments.
