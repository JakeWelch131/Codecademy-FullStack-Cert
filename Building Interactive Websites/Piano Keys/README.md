# Piano Keys

## The purpose of this project was to practice DOM events using JavaScript. Context: Youâ€™re a web developer who has been hired by a music education company. This client wants you to create an interactive game to help their beginner-level piano students study. Create a piano player with DOM events in JavaScript!
## The html and css were pre-written, I worked mainly in the main.js file.
