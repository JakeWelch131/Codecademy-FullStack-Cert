# CSS Grid: Task Board
## In this project, I created a board of to-do items organized into columns. All of the HTML and most of the CSS were written for me, but the grid property declarations were yet to be added.

## In order to complete this project, I needed to know how to lay out the structure of a gridâ€™s rows and columns and place items within that grid using CSS.
