I made the following color-related changes to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a home paint business:

- Exchange some named colors with hexadecimal color values.
- Add some semi-transparent overlays to the banner and footer using RGBA.
- Fill in the first color column of the swatch samples using HSL colors.
